## Tech Used

- Next.JS
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- React useReducer/useContext for state

### A Couple notes on architecture

The technical decisions were made within the context of a take home assignment. If this were an app with a longer lifespan I would have opted for different choices, starting first with state management (would probably opt for Redux Toolkit here). A planned trajectory of the app would have influenced technical decisions and design heavily, with the decisions being shaped by any discussions and goals surrounding the app.
